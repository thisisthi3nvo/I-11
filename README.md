Problem 3.3: After cleaning and processing the data in VS Code as you did in Google Colab, compare and contrast the experience of using VS Code with Google Colab for this workflow. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using VS Code for data analysis tasks, including but not limited to:
Ease of use and setup for data loading and manipulation
Resource management and computing power
Extension capabilities and customization options in VS Code vs. Colab’s built-in features
Collaboration capabilities (file sharing, notebook sharing, etc.)
Accessibility and portability across different devices and environments
Below is the comparison between using VS Code and Google Colab:
1. Ease of Use and Setup
VS Code: Requires more time to install various packages.
Google Colab: Ready-to-use with pre-installed packages. Easy to get started quickly without worrying about the environment setup.
2. Resource Management and Computing Power
VS Code: Uses local resources (CPU, RAM, etc.), so it's limited by our machine's capabilities.
Google Colab: Uses Google’s cloud resources, providing access to free GPUs and TPUs. 
3. Extension Capabilities and Customization
VS Code: Highly extensible with plugins
Google Colab: Limited to the built-in features. Extensions are not as flexible as VS Code.
4. Collaboration Capabilities
VS Code: Collaboration is possible using Git and GitHub, or extensions like Live Share, but requires some setup. 
Google Colab: Collaboration is seamless. Multiple users can work on the same notebook in real time, similar to Google Docs. Easy to share via links and integrate with Google Drive.
5. Accessibility and Portability
VS Code: Requires local installation. Projects can be ported using Git or cloud storage, but it requires more effort.
Google Colab: Accessible from any device with a web browser. No installation is required, making it more portable and easier to switch between devices.
